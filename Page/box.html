	<h1>Box example...</h1>
	<div id="Box">
		<h1 style="background-color: gray;margin: 30px;">Take this kiss upon the brow! And, in parting from you now, Thus much let me avow-
You are not wrong, who deem That my days have been a dream; Yet if hope has flown awayIn a night, or in a day,In a vision, or in noneIs it therefore the less gone?All that we see or seemIs but a dream within a dream. I stand amid the roar Of a surf-tormented shore, And I hold within my hand Grains of the golden sand- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep- while I weep! O God! can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp? O God! can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream?</h1>
